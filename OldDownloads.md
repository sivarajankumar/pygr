# How to Get Pygr #
Get it either by clicking the **Downloads** tab above (for source tar.gz or installers of recent releases), or by obtaining a copy of the Pygr git repository.  Read me here: UsingGit.

# Sourceforge Site #

Pygr was originally hosted on Sourceforge, but we have switched to a combination of Google Code (for the project page), and git (for version control).  You can download old versions of the software from the [Sourceforge site](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=145915).
