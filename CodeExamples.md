#summary Code snippets demonstrating how to accomplish various tasks with Pygr.

# Introduction #

This page is to list all code examples - that is, Wiki pages dedicated to performing various tasks with Pygr, which contain snippets of actual code. Since Wiki pages are not checked using doctests, such examples may or may not work with the latest version of Pygr code; collecting them all in one place not only helps users browse them but also facilitates manual checking. Many, if not all, code examples will eventually be incorporated into the Pygr Cookbook.
