Welcome to pygr!

Pygr is open source software designed to make it easy to do powerful sequence and comparative genomics analyses, even with extremely large multi-genome data sets. pygr includes:

  * Code for interacting with sequence databases, search methods such as BLAST, repeat-masking, megablast, etc.;
  * Querying and working with sequence annotation databases and sequence alignment datasets;
  * A data namespace for accessing a given resource with seamless data relationship management.
  * Easy data sharing that includes transparent access over network protocols.
  * High performance graph representation and query of interval-based data.

pygr is available under the New BSD license, written in Python, and actively used and developed by several groups.
